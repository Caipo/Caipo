## 🌱 Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

- [Reddit Image Scraper](https://github.com/Caipo/Reddit-Scraper): Used to rip 40,000 Images off reddit to create a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmonsterdino/reddit-meme-data-set).

- [Tribe Social](https://github.com/Caipo/tribes): A django site that uses posgres Sql and websockets that makes a chat app with account functionality.

- [Tinfoil Chat](https://github.com/Caipo/Tinfoil-Chat): Simple chat app that uses 2048 bit RSA encryption. Everything is made from scratch python and should be a good first example for someone who wants to start learning about encryption, gui's or networking.

- [Rent Automator](https://github.com/Caipo/Utilities-Automator): An automated web scraper that gets utillites bill from diffrent site and calculates rent then emails the cost to the tennets. This was built for my old landlord and good friend.

- [Terrorism Analysis](https://github.com/Caipo/Terrorism): Data analysis of the START global terrorism database useing juypter notebook, Tableau and map box.

- [Covid Tracker](https://github.com/Caipo/Covid-Tracker): Right when covid was taking off I made a python file to scrape wikipedia for the amount of covid cases (when it was still just in china), make a scatter plot, graph a best fit line (Exponitial Linear Regression) then make a 10 day prediction. Using this code I made the geuss the school would be online before classes finish of which I was right.

Gists that may intrest you 

- [Linerar Algebra Scripts](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/a4c82732688b8140c706f21aa63cb981): Some functions Ive made for my applyed linear algebra class that help me understand the concepts and double check my homework.

- [Liear Optimisation Scripts](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/43f35f45ec50293296ae2487e098cd81): Some Functions Ive made to help me write up my work in latex on my linear optimistion class.

- [RSA](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/8e00b1f3a0661db0b674ac786791ffa2): A toy model of rsa that generates proper primes of the right size and encrypts them. May take awhile to generate. This was inspired from my cryptography class where I wanted to get the full picture of RSA. 

- [Hangman](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/b5d1ac0566eb6f034ef69a5e9418e112): A school project using java that Ive made.

- [Prime sieve](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/f2d4f40a4b795ea90e4e8fbb55af0cc7): One of my first programs Ive made for no other reason then I wanted to make something Intresting. This combined my love of programing with my love of math which inspired manny other programs.

- [BattleShip Algorithem](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/31ecf6a41f142088119769a390bda6d8): Our class had a competition on who could make the best battleship algorthim. I Got so close to getting first but another student was just a little better then me. Somthing Im still salty about to this day. 

- [Covid II](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/ca3e26d77226f48f755b51cf3db36e0c): A project I made to visulise covid in BC becasue I couldent stop watching the news and I was stuck inside doing online classes.

- [Tire](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/bd6243a8904727501178c43fc0f5b56b): A coeworker I worked with had a side gig that he did where he would resell tires. I made this for him to webscrape all the sites he browsed and make an excel spread sheet. He didnt use it, but thats beside the point.

- [Calculus 4](https://gist.github.com/Caipo/9d5df1a3de13744bc254ad918f5538d3): A bad professor gave the class 70 tedious calculus 4 problems. This gave me a chip on my sholder so I made a python file to do the work for me and write it into latex. Would it be faster to just do the work ... yes but thats beside the point.
